title: Tools for managing information overload—and improving your thinking—are on the rise
---
These tools help you think, improve ideas, build knowledge, and expand brain capacity.

These tools can help you go from *idea capture* to *new thing created* if you use them effectively.

They help you make your ideas better by enabling you to browse your thoughts non-linearly, nurture your ideas over time, and improve your overall cognition and creativity.

These tools are built to work the way your brain works, which helps to optimize the interactions you have with your computer.  [[Non-linear writing’s ability to jump from sentence to sentence, idea to idea, changes the way the mind thinks through ideas]].

They’re simple pieces of software on the surface, with great depths of design and capability.

They’re designed to aid **your thinking** as opposed to aiding your processes: managing tasks, schedules, communications, etc.

When you capture, process, rework, and [[refine your ideas over time]], you boost your creativity and generate novel ideas more frequently, which leads to more—and better—creation. [[Ideas improve by writing about them not by thinking about them]], as [[Writing is thinking]], just more tangible.

Humans are the only species that creates. Of all the species in the world, we’re the only one to make art, cook food, and build technology. Creation is what makes us human.

So in that sense, we might as well do everything we can to improve the way we create things—*and* the thinking that goes in to the things we create.
