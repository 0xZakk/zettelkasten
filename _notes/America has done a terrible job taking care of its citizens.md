title: America has done a terrible job taking care of its citizens
---
The leading country in the world—the beacon of hope and freedom, land of opportunity and prosperity—cannot even take care of its own people.

The rich get richer while the poor get poorer, right here in plain sight.

Politicians are corrupt and making insider trades right in front of our eyes while failing to provide relief and support to their constituents when the crisis of the century strikes.

Wall Street is stealing directly from The People of [[America]] and when their own inventions are used against them, they find ways to shut down the little guy when they're beating Wall Street at their own game.

Market manipulation, corrupt capitalism, astronomical levels of inequality almost everywhere you look—we're living in a rigged system where greed and corruption know no bounds.

America has meddled in affairs around the world "spreading democracy" and "liberating people from tyranny" all while manipulating financial and political systems for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many.

While many folks may have known this all along, it seems that many more are waking up to the atrocities America has been directly responsible for since as far back as the 1600s.

[[America]] needs new leadership that truly represents the interest of The People, and it needs that leadership to destroy its existing systems in order to build them anew, with visions of equity, equality, and compassion for all.

One of the wealthiest nations in the world should be able to fully provide for the welfare of their people, but instead we're facing massive chasms of inequality that force the poor to slip further into poverty, all while the wealthiest people and companies add Billions and Trillions of U.S. Dollars to their balance sheets. (Enter: Bitcoin)

It's unfathomable that in such a wealthy nation people do not have access to fresh food.

In many parts of New Mexico, fresh food is hard to come by, even in better times. You can drive for miles without passing a supermarket. If you don’t have a car, the local dollar store may be the only place to get groceries.

They stay quiet about their gains until one day Regular Olde Joe Citizen figures out how to stick it to the man and give em a taste of their own medicine by exploiting the system to their advantage and forcing the wealthy to lose billions of dollars.

[[The Great Reset]] is turning out to be The Great Reckoning as the country grapples with its history of oppression, exploitation, and inequality. These forces are so deeply ingrained in the fabric of society and systems of governance that those of great privilege do not even recognize the reality of their impact.

[[Impact over intent]] is a concept I'm still working my way to fully understand, but it is certainly at play here. While this country may have been founded on the ideal of freedom and justice for all, it seems the founders were thinking only of themselves. In the year 2021, [[America]] looks very different than it did in 1776, and it's time for a redesign that results in entirely new systems, governance, and policies that work *for the people of America today*, not those who no longer live.

It's time to look internally and reflect on who we are, what we believe in, and how we can take care of our people. It's time for people to care for one another and take actions that result in the betterment of all people, not just the wealthy. It's time for the system to work for the people instead of the people working for the system.

All people. Cared for together. As one nation.
