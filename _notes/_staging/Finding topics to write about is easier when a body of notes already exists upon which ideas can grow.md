# Finding topics to write about is easier when a body of notes already exists upon which ideas can grow
Sitting down with a “what should I wrote about now?” approach often leads nowhere.

Instead, read new materials and make note of your thoughts. Write about the concepts you’re interested in and put those in your note-taking system as [[Evergreen notes]]. 

When you sit down to write you could, for clusters of notes and build upon your past thoughts in ways that help you [[refine your ideas over time]]. 

Regularly revisit  [[How to take smart notes]]. That’s your starting point for exploring, improving, and writing your ideas.

Tending to a [[digital garden]] can help you [[always have something to write about]]. Additionally, [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].
