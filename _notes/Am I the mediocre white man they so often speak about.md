Am I the 'mediocre white man' they so often speak about?

Me?

This strong, confident, courageous 30-something?

This privileged white cis-het man who hasn't really found himself but has made himself a nice life nonetheless?

What if I'm just ... meh?
What if I'm an embarrassment to myself?
What if I'm the fool?

These are the questions I find myself grappling with these days.

They're hard; they're raw. Pure emotion.
This business is personal.

What if I'm the mediocre white man?

What might that mean to me?
