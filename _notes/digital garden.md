Digital gardens are a relatively new way of publishing and tending to oneâ€™s ideas, knowledge, and thought explorations.

Theyâ€™re frequently made up of works-in-progress in the form of notesâ€”often unpolished and unfinishedâ€”that are deeply interconnected and linked with one another.

The gardening language is a beautiful analogy for how we plant, tend, and grow our ideas publicly. Some bloom faster than others, some are evergreen, and some of the seeds just donâ€™t take. Such is gardening ðŸŒ±.

Many digital gardens adhere to some basic tenets which help cultivate the digital soil in a healthy and effective way.
- Bidirectional linking between notes is essential
- Most pages are somewhere between raw notes and polished essays
- The garden is a system of networked thought designed to facilitate capturing, linking, and remixing ideas
- Each garden provides a source of inspiration more effective than a spark file due to their heavily interconnected notes
- Theyâ€™re all about thinking out loud and in public and working with the garage door open
- Many strive to be collaborative and inviting of others

When you [[Learn in public]], you build connection between ideas and people. [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].  It also helps that [[public notes build authority and trust]].

Tending to digital gardens helps make sure you [[always have something to write about]], consistently [[build a body of work]], and frequently have the opportunity to share your [[web of thinking]] with others, as a beacon for likeminded people.

[[Finding topics to write about is easier when a body of notes already exists upon which ideas can grow]], so digital gardens aim to facilitate curiosity, creativity, and creation.
