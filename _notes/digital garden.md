Digital gardens are a relatively new way of publishing and tending to one’s ideas, knowledge, and thought explorations.

They’re frequently made up of works-in-progress in the form of notes—often unpolished and unfinished—that are deeply interconnected and linked with one another. Most importantly, they are created for you, the creator.

“With blogging, you’re talking to a large audience,” he says. “With digital gardening, you’re talking to yourself. You focus on what you want to cultivate over time.”

The gardening language is a beautiful analogy for how we plant, tend, and grow our ideas publicly. Some bloom faster than others, some are evergreen, and some of the seeds just don’t take. Such is gardening 🌱.

Many digital gardens adhere to some basic tenets which help cultivate the digital soil in a healthy and effective way.
- Bidirectional linking between notes is essential
- Most pages are somewhere between raw notes and polished essays
- The garden is a system of networked thought designed to facilitate capturing, linking, and remixing ideas
- Each garden provides a source of inspiration more effective than a spark file due to their heavily interconnected notes
- They’re all about thinking out loud and in public and working with the garage door open
- Many strive to be collaborative and inviting of others

When you [[Learn in public]], you build connection between ideas and people. [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].  It also helps that [[public notes build authority and trust]].

Tending to digital gardens helps make sure you [[always have something to write about]], consistently [[build a body of work]], and frequently have the opportunity to share your [[web of thinking]] with others, as a beacon for likeminded people.

[[Finding topics to write about is easier when a body of notes already exists upon which ideas can grow]], so digital gardens aim to facilitate curiosity, creativity, and creation.
