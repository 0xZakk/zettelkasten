title: The ability to jump from sentence to sentence, idea to idea, changes the way the mind works
---

No longer do I have to think so diligently about what I want the next sentence to say; instead, I can have a thought, and jump to a different part of the digital page and insert my thought there. When I'm at a point of review, I can rearrange paragraphs and sentences on the fly, mixing and remixing words and thoughts until the sentence feels right.

This is not a new concept—Microsoft Word has been around forever—but my thinking about it is new, and I’m fascinated by how, over time, [[non-linear writing can help build a body of work]].
