title: I am looking for new and meaningful projects in 2021
---

I’m at a point in life where I’m looking for more meaningful and impactful projects to work on and orgs/missions to contribute to.

If you’re working on tough-yet-important problems that actually create positive change for people and communities, I would love to talk with you.

### Specifically, I’d like to apply myself to:
- Sustainability & climate change
- Racial, economic, & social justice
- Modernizing government (local &/or fed)
- Improving philly public education
- Local community, co-ops, biz models
- Food justice & systems
- Tech & internet ethics

I want to make our important systems more equitable, accessible, and intuitive, and I want to do so alongside others.

I’m not sure where to start finding these projects, so I turn to you, Twitter friends, to see if you know people I might want to connect with in these areas.

Over my career I’ve done many different types of work, but the common thread has been helping people and organizations improve experiences, systems, and operations. You can learn more about me and my work on [my personal site](https://miketannenbaum.com) — I appreciate any and all of your support!
