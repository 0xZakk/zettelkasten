title: reduce single-use plastic
--- 
Plastic is EVERYWHERE. Clothes, cleaning products, food etc.

Some things I do to reduce single-use plastic in my life:
- Reusable bags‚ÄîALWAYS
- Carry a reusable water bottle everywhere
- Carry reusable silverware, too
- Don't put produce in plastic bags, just wash it at home
- Shop bulk grocery with reusable containers
	- Bulk doesn't mean extra-large product sizes, it means **no consumer packaging at all**
	- Spices, coffee and tea, pasta, granola, flour, chocolate, beans, grains‚Äîso much can be found in bulk when you look for bulk grocery stores
- Reduce and limit take out and delivery meals
- Skip to-go coffees unless it can be in a refillable container (damn you, pandemic)

## üöß ‚ö†Ô∏è Rough Terrain Ahead ‚ö†Ô∏è üöß
> *üõë  **What's this?** ‚úçÔ∏è  This whole note is a work in progress, but the below part is really rough. So why's it here? [[Share ideas before they‚Äôre ready]].*

While we try to prevent un-recyclable materials from entering our house to begin with, it's nearly impossible to do, so we spend a lot of effort working to reduce what we *do* use. For almost all plastics, and [many other materials](https://rabbitrecycling.com/RabbitRecyclingList.pdf), we pay [a local business](https://rabbitrecycling.com) to take buckets and tubs of our un-recyclable waste and give/sell it to people and businesses who actually want it.

I look at it as a tax on the convenience of single-use items like food bars, frozen food, to-go iced coffees, and medication containers, in addition to being an excellent way to care for the un-recyclable materials that so frequently make it into our home.
