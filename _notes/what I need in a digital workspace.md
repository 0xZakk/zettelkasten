title: what I need in a digital workspace
---
[[I want somewhere to be My Workspace™]], and I want that somewhere to have what I consider critical capabilities for me:
- Bidirectional links
- Block references
- Fast search
- Fast sync
- Seamless mobile experience 
- Private, Secure, Offline
- Daily Notes *
- Unlinked references *
- Hotkeys
- Easy export
- Deeplinks
- Easy “processing notes” workflow
- Easy selection and rearrangement of blocks

*`*` Asterisk represents the capabilities Craft does not have. See below for more detail.*

## Nice to haves
- Collaborative features: comments, easy sharing, multiplayer
- Tags *
- Pretty interface and delightful UX

To meet the needs above I rely on [[my digital ecosystem]], with most of my work being handled by a few specialized tools:
- [[Craft is my workspace]]
- [[Things is for getting shit done]]
- [[Drafts is for immediate note capture]]
- [[Obsidian is for building my body of work]] and tending this [[digital garden]]

It's been a fascinating [[evolution of the ecosystem]] and I've learned so much about new tools, including how [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]. 

I do believe [[A knowledge worker’s toolkit needs to be well-rounded]], but tools can also be distracting so it's a fine line to tow. Hopefully I can settle in to my new system and really [[build a body of work]].
