title: Craft is my workspace
---
The new-to-market app [Craft](https://craft.do){:target="_blank"} has quickly won my heart and is now taking the lead as contender for my main digital workspace. This decision comes after writing down and deeply exploring [[what I need in a digital workspace]].

Craft, for me, is my private, messy workspace full of diverse content and context. It's kind of like my office environment + desk space + digital brain, as opposed to a polished presentation or creation. It's for everything from capture to works in progress to published writing and presentations.

In the flip side, [[Obsidian is for building my body of work]], which is more polished and used for this [[digital garden]]. While I debated between the two tools for a long time, I settled on Craft because it meets almost all my needs for [[my digital ecosystem]].

## How I Use Craft
Everything happens in Craft except task and project management. [[Things is for getting shit done]] and it'll stay my number one because it's that damn good at what it does.

With Craft, everything starts with my Interstitial Journal. I log what I'm doing in the moment—with a timestamp—and go from there.

### Organizing my work
I take notes from conversations in Craft and then they're linked to the date and any `@-mentioned` tags (`[[also works]]`). All people, companies, and touchpoints are noted in the app.

Since [[Drafts is for immediate note capture]], when I process my Drafts inbox I send quite a few items to Craft. This includes fleeting notes and ideas, highlights from readings, and even longer-form idea capture. Wherever it starts, all of it ends up in either Craft or Things for the next level of processing.

I have multiple pages (eventually will be tags, I think) that allow me to quickly `@-mention` the page and then see what's important. As examples, these pages show me everything I need under the respective category:
* `to-process` — My inbox in Craft
* `to-write` — A collection of ideas to write about, expand upon, and publish
* `to-read` — For active reading related to a project or priority learning need
* `in-progress` — Actively being worked on
* `waiting-on` — Out of my hands and mind but not forgotten about
* `PRIORITY` — These come first when processing
* `sparks` — Ideas for the future
* `[ ]`  — To Dos, though I don't really use this feature since it's not that powerful

### Organizing my projects
Once again, I don't use Craft as a project management tool. [[Things is for getting shit done]] and keeping track of deadlines and dates.

In Craft, however, everything else resides. Documents that are project-specific are titled `P: Project Name` so I can easily find them. Each doc contains sub-pages within sub-pages of resources, writings, references, and all relevant digital bits and bytes, in an organically-unfolding structure that's neither too much nor too little.

I don't think about hierarchy too much as a quick `⌘+O` brings up one of the speediest searches I've ever used and helps me find what I need (go native apps!).

I have created some folders because there are some things that need hierarchy, and I've used a PARA approach for this: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive. Each of those folders has as few sub-folders as possible since hierarchy doesn't really help. I only use sub-folders for categories like `Household`, `Client Work`, `Crypto` and topics I know will forever be grouped under that umbrella. Everything is still interconnected, but the folders make it easy to see *only* crypto content when I want, even if the word `crypto` isn't actually found within a document.

> I'll expand more on this over time but for now this is my setup. Hope it helps!

## What's missing from Craft

### Tags
Nested tags are coming to Craft—as I've seen mentioned in the Craft Slack community—though I'm not sure how they're being implemented. I believe they're modeled after Bear, which was one of my favorite features of that app. Can't wait to have 'em in Craft!

### Unlinked references
I found immense utility in the unlinked references section of Roam Research and it's probably what I miss most now that Craft implemented their daily notes and calendar features. 

I learned about the concept when I was exploring [[Why I like Roam over Bear for improving my thinking]]. Since then I've been collecting my own notes, highlights from what I read, and so much more, and then noticing connections I wouldn't have thought of on my own. That's cool.

What's even cooler is that I can write whatever I want in the system (Roam Research does this best) and not have to worry about linking anything together at all. Then, when a time comes for it to be valuable to have two or more notes linked together, it's real easy to look at the `Unlinked References` section of a note and quickly add links between them.

I miss this a lot in Craft, and truly hope they build it in. But, for the time being, the fact that **Craft does pretty much everything else I need my main workhorse app to do**—and has a thriving community that's fun to be a part of—is truly exciting to me.
