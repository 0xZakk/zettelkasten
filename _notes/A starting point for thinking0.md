title: A starting point for thinking
---
Hi, I’m Mike.

You’ve stumbled into my workspace. Welcome!

This is where I think. It’s a bit unusual of a space and it’s not like most sites. Rooted in networked thought, [[these notes are written for myself]] and are highly interwoven to facilitate the connection of seemingly disparate ideas with one another. It’s an experiment in service of exploring new ways of thinking. By improving the way I refine, articulate, and share my ideas, I get better at thinking. Since I think for a living, it’s important to keep my mind in shape.

I believe writing is thinking. This is a system that helps me do both. [[It’s not a writing system, it’s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing]].

The best way to explore is just to jump in. I’d recommend starting with [[What has my attention now]]. I maintain my [[web of thinking]] to help me develop ideas through spaced repetition and networked thought.

Whatever thoughts you capture and ideas you spark, you’re encouraged to share them with me! I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) on occasion, and you can always visit [my main personal site](https://miketannenbaum.com) to explore my [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
