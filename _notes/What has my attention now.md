		* [[A knowledge worker’s toolkit needs to be well-rounded]]
		* [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]

- [[think in terms of inputs and outputs to design better processes]]
* [[Sensemaking and wayfinding are critical skills for thriving in 2020 and beyond]]
- How to [[build a body of work]] over time
	- [[It feels like there’s a new internet being built with the principle of the early days—sharing and connecting knowledge—but with the wisdom of today, accumulated over decades of improving technology’s capabilities]]
