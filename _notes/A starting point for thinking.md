title: A starting point for thinking
---
Hi, I’m Mike.

You’ve stumbled into my workspace. Welcome!

It’s a bit of an unusual space and it’s not like most sites. This is where I think.

Rooted in networked thought, <a href="these%20notes%20are%20written%20for%20myself">these notes are written for myself</a> and are highly interwoven to facilitate the connection of seemingly disparate ideas with one another. It’s an experiment in service of exploring new ways of thinking. By improving the way I refine, articulate, and share my ideas, I get better at thinking. Since I think for a living, it’s important to keep my mind in shape.

I believe writing is thinking, and this system facilitates both, though <a href="It’s%20not%20a%20writing%20system,%20it’s%20a%20thinking%20system%20whose%20byproduct%20is%20writing">It’s not a writing system, it’s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing</a>. I'm in the early stages of building and this is very much an experiment in working in public. It's a perpetual work in progress that evolves over time—which is the beauty of it!

The best way to explore is just to jump in. I’d recommend starting with <a href="What%20has%20my%20attention%20now">what has my attention now</a>. I maintain my <a href="web%20of%20thinking">web of thinking</a> to help me develop ideas through spaced repetition and networked thought.

Whatever thoughts you capture and ideas you spark, you’re encouraged to share them with me! I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) on occasion, and you can always visit [my main personal site](https://miketannenbaum.com) to explore my [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
