title: A starting point for thinking
---
Hi, Iâ€™m Mike! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to The Refined Mind, which is the fancy name I gave to this boring website.

This is my tiny plot on the internet where I share ideas in progress. It's my public workspace and an experiment in what's known as [[digital garden]]ing.

I believe [[Writing is thinking]], so [[these notes are written for myself]] to aid my thinking, learning, and creating.

This site is a diverse ecosystem of notes all interlinked in some way and evolving at different rates. Most of the notes fall within these [[Writing themes]] and some of the concepts and words might be incorrect. Fortunately, that's what this whole site is about: evolving my thinking by challenging existing beliefs, assumptions, and mental models.

The best way to get started is to explore the [[changelog]] of recent updates and additions along with [[What has my attention now]]. Feel free to click any link that catches your curiosity, as each provides a choose-your-own-adventure-style pathway into my [[web of thinking]].

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
