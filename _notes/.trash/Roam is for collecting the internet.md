title: Roam is for collecting the internet

Roam grabs things from around the web.

Highlights. Concepts. Knowledge.

Roam IS the inbox. The whole thing.

Tasks are tactical.

Roam is the catch all for words and ideas from around the web. It's a web app so it is sandboxed to the internet, but it is not for processing personal thoughts or wisdom.
