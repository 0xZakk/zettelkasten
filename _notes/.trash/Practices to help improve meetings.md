# Practices to help improve meetings

> **Summary:** This post calls out key challenges in meeting culture, asks questions to help design and run more effective meetings, and provides five concepts to improve any meeting.

From our internal survey and your work on the Miro board we’ve learned some meeting basics which help make them more effective yet are frequently lacking within our current meeting culture:

- ### **Agendas**

Highly effective yet often missing. All meetings should have agendas that clearly explain the type of meeting, define key objectives, outline the flow, and provide context to help people come prepared.

> How might we make sure every meeting invite includes a proper agenda?

- ### **Preparation**

Highly effective yet many people commented on the lack of overall preparation. Could be no time to prepare (back to back) or weren't provided enough context. Either way, preparation goes a long way.

> How might we make sure every meeting participant has the time to properly prepare?

- ### **Focus**

Multitasking is a challenge many people called out, so let's think about how we might facilitate environments where people are present during meetings.

> How might we facilitate presence, full attention, and single-tasking during meetings, especially when workdays seemingly require multiple things being done at once?

- ### **Recaps**

Clearly defined next steps + documentation of decisions made, open items, etc were noted as very helpful, yet many meetings do not have proper followup or a "single source of truth" for people to revisit the activity and outcome of meetings on their own time.

> How might we make sure meetings are effectively documented and made accessible to all people?

## Concepts to Explore

Here are some ideas to help you explore new ways to run your meetings. Perhaps something sparks an idea for you. If so, please try it, make notes on your experience, and share what you learn!

- ### **Action Meetings > Status Meetings**

Quickly capture the to-dos (AKA actions) required by the team while avoiding distraction

> *The goal of an Action Meeting is to quickly get your team together and capture the to-dos (AKA actions) required by the team this week.* ***Don’t use the meeting itself to try to solve a messy problem or come to a consensus on a decision**.*

- ### **Decisions > Discussions**

Better meeting structure helps people effectively make decisions and quickly get the team back to work

> *The team shouldn’t sit in the room pretending to align only to leave the room to complain and undermine the decision with their teams. Give everyone one last chance to reflect and react and then promise, as a group, to move forward together*

- ### **Facilitator and Scribe**

Every meeting needs at least these two people to be clearly identified—one to run the meeting and one to take notes. Note-taking should not fall entirely on the PM every time. This can be a shared responsibility—it can even be real-time collaborative!

- ### **Meeting Check-Ins**

Start every meeting promptly by asking "what has your attention?"; each person answers in one or two sentences. This helps clear people’s minds while bringing their attention into the present.

- ### **Inputs and Outputs**

Think in terms of inputs and outputs of meetings:

- What do we need to get out of this meeting?
- What can I bring to the meeting (inputs) that will help us get to that result (output)?
- What do other people need to bring (inputs)?

> How might I best prepare everyone and design the meeting in ways that generate the outputs we’re seeking?
