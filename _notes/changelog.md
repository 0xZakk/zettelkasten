## 2021-01-29 â€” More on American inequality
### Added
- [[America has done a terrible job taking care of its citizens]]

## 2021-01-19 â€” Obsidian, Roam Research, and note updates
### Added
- [[Obsidian is for tending my digital garden]]
> The tool is designed for [[networked thinking]] and automatically connects notes with one another to help you build out your [[web of thinking]] by writing similarly to how we think: non-linearly.
- [Newsletter signup form](a-starting-point-for-thinking) on notes pages

### Updated
- Renamed *My new design system* to [[my digital ecosystem]] and totally reworked the note
> After much experimentation and exploration of new practices and tools, Iâ€™ve made significant improvements to my learning and knowledge management system. It's considered a work in progress, however, as it's always being iterated on and improved as my needs evolve and change.

- Added products I love to [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]
> These tools can help you go from *idea capture* to *new thing created* if you use them effectively.

- Renamed "How to take smart notes" to "[[How I take smart notes]]" because I can only share what works for me, not what others should do
> Taking notes is about collecting information and ideas in *this* moment, and making them available for our *future* selves to act upon. Weâ€™re seeding ideas now and helping them grow stronger as we explore and learn new things.

- [[Drafts is for immediate note capture and works in progress]]
> Instead of having a thought and then thinking â€œwhere do I want to put this?"â€”and then having to think about what app to open, the only concern is immediately capturing the thought. BAM. done.

- [[Evernote is for long-term storage]]
> The content in Evernote is interacted with less frequently, but is housed in a trustworthy place. It's a great place to store things that need to be recalled on occasion but aren't interacted with regularly.
