title: Obsidian is for building my body of work
---
[Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/){:target="_blank"} is a new-to-market knowledge management tool that runs on locally-stored markdown files. No cloud or web servers involved.

[[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]], and Obsidian is one of these tools.

> Obsidian helps build and improve ideas over time by linking your thinking

The tool is designed for [[networked thinking]] and automatically connects notes with one another to help you build out your [[web of thinking]] by writing similarly to how we think: non-linearly.

[[Non-linear writing’s ability to jump from sentence to sentence, idea to idea, changes the way the mind thinks through ideas]].  Obsidian helps you ride the waves of your thoughts, clicking from one idea to the next, writing a bit here and a bit there, while encouraging you to connect you notes with one another to help build out ideas. It's a wonderful tool for practicing [[zoom-in-zoom-out thinking]].

[[Ideas improve by writing about them not by thinking about them]], and Obsidian is here to help you [[refine your ideas over time]], [[stack the bricks]], and[[build a body of work]].

That said, [[It’s not a writing system, it’s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing]], and Obsidian makes it easy to iterate on ideas and publish them to this site through a git workflow and Jekyll website, which also runs on markdown files.

It's all an experiment for me, but Obsidian has now overtaken Bear as my go to app for tending this [[digital garden]] because of the speed at which it helps me process ideas and turn them into more complete pieces of work. Bear, while I love the app through and through, made updating and keeping note links in sync a manual and cumbersome process that took unnecessary time. Obsidian does those things for me, so Bear is out.

While [[these notes are written for myself]], it's important to [[Share ideas before they’re ready]], and Obsidian helps advance many ideas simultaneously by making it easy to build on any thought at any time. With the app being focused on text and text only, it removes the distractions of visuals, file management, structure and hierarchy needs and more.

It's an interesting way to think and write, and still very experimental for me. Who knows what comes from caring for the ideas in this [[digital garden]].
