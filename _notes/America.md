[[America has done a terrible job taking care of its citizens]]. The systems are rigged in favor of the rich, and the history we've been sold through school is littered with America-as-savior propaganda.

[[The land of the free is such a lie]].

America stole people from their home continent and brought them here against their will.

They enslaved those people and forced them to labor tirelessly or lose their life.

When the slavery system was shut down, the slavers found new ways to control the bodies of the Africans they claimed to have owned.

By keeping Black people down, America’s wealthy elite could continue to exploit Black labor for profit without any regard for Black life.

One system of oppression ends and another takes its place.

Slavery.
Reconstruction.
Jim Crow.
Mass incarceration.

American government was designed to create a country where wealthy white people rule over everyone else by oppressing minorities.

The system is working exactly as it was designed.

It’s time to redesign the system.
