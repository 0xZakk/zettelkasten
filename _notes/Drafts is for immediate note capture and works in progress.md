> *This note is part of a small series highlighting [[my digital ecosystem]].*

When an idea pops up—whether a task, a reminder, or something more expansive—[Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/){:target="_blank"} is the app that gets opened on mobile to quickly capture thoughts.

### Every piece of writing starts in Drafts
Whether a note to myself, an email to be composed, or something to remind myself later, it all starts in Drafts.

Instead of having a thought and then thinking “where do I want to put this?"—and then having to think about what app to open, the only concern is immediately capturing the thought. BAM. done.

Once words are on the digital page, *then* a note can be processed and moved to the next part of the system.

When you [[Take notes in your own words while reading, watching, and thinking]], you'll find that your Drafts inbox is never empty—which means it's important to process notes on a regular basis!

### Drafts is also where works in progress take place
What might start as an incomplete thought eventually become something more concrete.

Sparks get processed and turned into tweets, [[digital garden]] seedlings, or longer-form essays.

When an idea or note becomes completed—a temporary state, due to the ever-evolving nature of tending the garden—it's moved through [[my digital ecosystem]] and into the digital systen.

Drafts is where everything starts.
