title: Drafts is for immediate note capture and works in progress
---
*This note is part of a small series highlighting [[My new system design]].*

Drafts is the *only* app ever opened on mobile when an idea pops up.

Instead of thinking “where do I want to put this note?—email, twitter, reminders, etc—the only concern is immediately capturing the thought. Once words are on the digital page, *then* a note can be processed.

Drafts is where works in progress take place as well. What might start as incomplete thoughts eventually become something more concrete.

When an idea or note becomes completed—which is a temporary state, as they’ll always evolved—they are moved to Bear.

[[Bear is for networked thinking]]. Drafts is where everything starts.
