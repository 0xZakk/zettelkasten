title: Finding topics to write about is most effective when a body of notes already exists and all we have to do is look at where there is density of notes

Sitting down with a “what should I wrote about now?” approach often leads nowhere.

Instead, read and write your thoughts. Rewrite in your own words the concepts you’re interested in. Put those in your note-taking system as [[Evergreen notes]]. When you want to write, look for dense clusters of notes and turn them into a manuscript. That’s where data visualization and basic wiki technology can be so powerful.

Remember [[How to take smart notes]]. That’s your starting point for exploring, improving, and writing your ideas.

Tending to a [[Digital Mind Garden]] can help you [[always have something write about]]. Additionally, [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].
