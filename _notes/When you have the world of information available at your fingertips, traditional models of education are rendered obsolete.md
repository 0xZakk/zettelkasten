Students can learn to navigate through the web and chase their curiosity, seeking out whatever knowledge and skills call to them as they explore.

These learning pathways are complimented by teaching _how_ to learn, opportunities to socialize with other children, and critical life skills like problem solving and creative writing.

Knowing how to think, how to create, and how to socialize are perhaps the penultimate skills of our lives, second only to knowing how to learn. [[Sensemaking and wayfinding are critical skills for thriving in 2020 and beyond]].

Sitting at desks in classrooms with teachers is no longer the optimal model to prepare children to thrive in their futures. Coaching, mentoring, and foundational life skill courses are necessary for helping kids do their best.

Furthermore, digital tools enable so many new ways to learn and gain understanding of the world. [[Non-linear writingâ€™s ability to jump from sentence to sentence, idea to idea, changes the way the mind thinks through ideas]]. Just like [[browsing the internet through multiple tabs is non-linear thinking]], [[non-linear writing helps ideas improve and evolve]], and can be used by students of all ages to explore their ideas and curiosities.
