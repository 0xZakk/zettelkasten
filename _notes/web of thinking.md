Showing people what you think about, how you evolve your ideas, and how they all connect with one another is a great way to [[build a body of work]].

Thinking isn’t linear and neither is your body of work. 

As creative and knowledge workers we often accumulate notes and ideas that exist alone by themselves, which is a disservice to ourselves as creativity comes when we make connections between ideas and concepts. This is what has led me to [[my digital ecosystem]], and the reason behind why I’m now [[Tinkering with Roam Research]]. It’s also what is pushing me to explore [[Why I like Roam over Bear for improving my thinking]].

[[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]. [[public notes build authority and trust]] while also showing how your ideas connect together. This forms a [[web of thinking]] that can be explored from virtually any entry point—perhaps as [[zoom-in-zoom-out thinking]].

When there’s a critical mass of [[Evergreen notes]], it’s likely that no two readers will take the same path through your thoughts and ideas, which means you’ll be giving everyone an experience unique to them while simultaneously offering up the ideas you find most intriguing and worthy of exploring.

Finally, [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].
