title: Finding topics to write about is most effective when a body of notes already exists and all we have to do is look at where there is density and cluster of notes

Sitting down with a “what should I wrote about now?” approach leads nowhere.

Read. Write your thoughts. Rewrite in your own words the concepts you’re interested in. Put those in the slip box. When you want to write, look for clusters of notes and turn them into a manuscript. That’s where tools like Roam Research can be so powerful.

Remember [[How to take smart notes]]. That’s your starting point for exploring, improving, and writing your ideas.
