Receptive to comments and excited by public discourse.

Created to share ideas with the world in search of people with similar interests and world views, or even totally different perspectives and past experiences.

Built within a community of people similarly interested in blogging and the simple, slow web.

This community has inspired me to [[Share ideas before they’re ready]] because [[public notes build authority and trust]].
