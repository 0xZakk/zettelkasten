title: Friday is for closing loops, weekly reviews, and funky tunes

Fridays are a celebration.

Monday - Wednesday are great for doing work, finding creative zones, writing, scheduling tasks, appointments, and priorities.

Thursday is great as a flex day that’s left open for any spillover.

Friday—the entirety of it—is about cleaning up from the week and preparing for the week ahead. It’s a whole day dedicated to mis en place.
