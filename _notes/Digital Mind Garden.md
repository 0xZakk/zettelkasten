title: Digital Mind Garden
---
A digital garden is a place to plant, tend, and grow ideas—publicly
- Bidirectional linking required
- Somewhere between raw notes and polished essay
- A system of networked thought
- Capture, link, and remix ideas
- A source of inspiration more effective than a spark file
- Thinking out loud and in public
- Collaborative and inviting

[[Learning in public]] builds connection because [[public notes build authority and trust]]. [[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]].

Similarly, tending to digital gardens helps make sure you [[always have something write about]], are always able to [[explore your curiosities]], and frequently have the opportunity to [[follow your interests]] wherever they may lead.

This is true because [[Finding topics to write about is most effective when a body of notes already exists and all we have to do is look at where there is density of notes]].
