  <h1>Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

Youâ€™ve stumbled into my workspace. Welcome!

This is where I think. Itâ€™s a bit unusual of a space and itâ€™s not like most sites. Rooted in networked thought, <a href="these%20notes%20are%20written%20for%20myself">these notes are written for myself</a> and are highly interwoven to facilitate the connection of seemingly disparate ideas with one another. Itâ€™s an experiment in service of exploring new ways of thinking. By improving the way I refine, articulate, and share my ideas, I get better at thinking. Since I think for a living, itâ€™s important to keep my mind in shape.

I believe writing is thinking. This is a system that helps me do both. <a href="Itâ€™s%20not%20a%20writing%20system,%20itâ€™s%20a%20thinking%20system%20whose%20byproduct%20is%20writing">Itâ€™s not a writing system, itâ€™s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing</a>.

The best way to explore is just to jump in. Iâ€™d recommend starting with <a href="What%20has%20my%20attention%20now">what has my attention now</a>. I maintain my <a href="web%20of%20thinking">web of thinking</a> to help me develop ideas through spaced repetition and networked thought.

Whatever thoughts you capture and ideas you spark, youâ€™re encouraged to share them with me! I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) on occasion, and you can always visit [my main personal site](https://miketannenbaum.com) to explore my [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
