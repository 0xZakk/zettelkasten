  <h1>Hi, I'm Zakk! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

I'm a Solidity developer and co-founder of Cabin DAO.

I like cooking, hiking, and reading. I also write about a couple of different topics, including: [technology](/technology), [building the future](/building-the-future), [high-performance knowledge work](/high-performance-knowledge-work), [building a great and sustaining business](/great-business), and [managing teams](/management).

This is my personal website, where you can learn [about me](/about), [my work](/work), and [my writing](/articles). Perhaps the best way to get started is to explore [my articles](/articles), review the site's [changelog](/changelog), or look through some of the things I'm [thinking about](/domains).

The best way to reach me is on Twitter or on Discord.


<!-- Welcome to my slipbox, which is the fancy name I gave to this boring website.


I believe <a href="writing-is-thinking">writing is thinking</a>, so <a href="these-notes-are-written-for-myself">these notes are written for myself</a> to aid my thinking, learning, and creating.

This site is a diverse ecosystem of interlinked notes all evolving at different rates. Most of the notes fall within these <a href="/Writing-themes">themes</a> and some of the concepts and words might be incorrect. Fortunately, that's what this whole site is about: evolving my thinking by challenging existing beliefs, assumptions, and mental models. Please feel free to do the same, either in the comments sections or on Twitter.

The best way to get started exploring is to look at the <a href="changelog">changelog</a> of recent updates and additions. You could also check out <a href="What-has-my-attention-now">what has my attention now</a>. Feel free to click any link that catches your curiosity, as each provides a choose-your-own-adventure-style pathway into my <a href="web-of-thinking">web of thinking</a>.

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:letstalk@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/miketnnnbm) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.

I run an independent software consultancy aimed at helping clients leverage the latest technologies. I love working with companies of all sizes, which I like to phrase as: helping the small be mighty and the big be nimble.

The early stages of the information age have shown us that there are very few things that can accelerate your business strategy like technology.

We've seen some incredibles things as a result. A company can analyze its data and know a shopper is pregnant before she does (Target). Machine learning can be used to detect and prevent fraud (PayPal). And a group of friends can build a billion dollar app in a few years (Instagram).

I look forward to working with you. The possibilities are endless.

Sincerely,

Zakk Fleischmann,
Hawthorne Interactive
Founder & CEO -->
