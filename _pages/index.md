  <h1>Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

Youâ€™ve stumbled into my public workspace. Welcome!

This is where I share my thinking, though <a href="these-notes-are-written-for-myself">these notes are written for myself</a>. I believe <a href="writing-is-thinking">writing is thinking</a>, and this is my attempt to write and think in public.

It's a perpetual work in progress and evolves along with my thinking, most of which fall within these <a href="/Writing-themes">writing themes</a>. Some of the concepts and words on this site might be incorrect or in need of refinement, but that's exactly the pointâ€”to challenge existing beliefs, assumptions, and mental models.

Feel free to explore <a href="What-has-my-attention-now">what has my attention now</a>, my <a href="web-of-thinking">web of thinking</a>, or any of the links that catch your curiosity.

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
