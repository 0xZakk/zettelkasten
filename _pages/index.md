  <h1>Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

Welcome to The Refined Mind, which is the fancy name I gave to this boring website.

This is my tiny plot on the internet where I share ideas in progress. It's my public workspace and an experiment in what's known as digital gardening.

I believe <a href="writing-is-thinking">writing is thinking</a>, so <a href="these-notes-are-written-for-myself">these notes are written for myself</a> to aid my thinking, learning, and creating.

This site is a diverse ecosystem of notes, all of which are interlinked in some way, each evolving at a different rate than the others. Most of the notes fall within these <a href="/Writing-themes">themes</a> and many of the concepts and words might be incorrect. Fortunately, that's what this whole site is about: evolving my thinking by challenging existing beliefs, assumptions, and mental models.

Feel free to explore <a href="What-has-my-attention-now">what has my attention</a>, my <a href="web-of-thinking">web of thinking</a>, the <a href="changelog">latest updates</a>, and any link that catches your curiosity.

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:letstalk@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
