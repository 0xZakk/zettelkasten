  <h1>Hi, I'm Mike! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
</div>

Youâ€™ve stumbled into my public workspace.

Itâ€™s a bit unusual and unlike most sites. This is where I share my thinking, though <a href="these%20notes%20are%20written%20for%20myself">these notes are written for myself</a>.

I believe <a href="writing%20is%20thinking">writing is thinking</a>, and this is my attempt to write and think in public. It's a perpetual work in progress and evolves along with my ideas, most of which fall within these <a href="/Writing%20themes">writing themes</a>.

Feel free to explore <a href="What%20has%20my%20attention%20now">what has my attention now</a>, my <a href="web%20of%20thinking">web of thinking</a>, or any of the links that catch your curiosity.

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
